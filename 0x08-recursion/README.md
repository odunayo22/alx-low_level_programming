		Task 0
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

		Task 1
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

		Task 2
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.

		Task 3
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1

		Task 4
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more.

		Task 5
Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.

		Task 6
. Inception. Is it possible?
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);

		Task 7
